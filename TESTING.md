# Testing

I have used the W3C validators to make sure my HTML and CSS codes have no errors. The links for these can be found below:
- W3C CSS validation (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- W3C Markup Validation (https://validator.w3.org/)

I used http://pep8online.com/ to check for errors in the python code

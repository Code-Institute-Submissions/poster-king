Link to view the website - https://poster-king.herokuapp.com/

I am creating an e-commerce website for selling posters and will be called Poster King.  The website will be a site where users can browse through different posters and will be able to purchase them. The website will be sports posters at the start but I have the option down the line to add different categories.

The website will have a login page which will then bring them to the main shopping page where they will be able to browse through all the products or select from different categories. Once a user adds their product to the basket then they will be able to purchase them entering in delivery and payment details. The user will also be able to see what they have purchased in the past where it will be linked to their username. If the customer currently does not have an account then they will be able to create one. When they create an account, they will also be able to change email, password and other details related to their account.

# UX
This website is based for people of all ages who like collecting sports posters. There is a big demand for posters for people to frame and to put up on theirs walls.

The posters on the site will be for combat sports fans so I will have a variation of UFC, WWE and Boxing posters as there is a big fan base for all 3 sports which I am also a fan of.

## Committing files to GitHub
When I make changes to each file I push them from GitHub from GitPod and below are the steps I do to do this. This is essential as to not losing any of the work I have done.
1.	On my GitPod project scroll down and click on the command prompt at the bottom.
2. Check status by typing in âgit statusâ.
3.	Type âgit addâ to add the files for staging.
4.	Type âgit commit -m "Add all files" to commit the files.
5.	Type âgit pushâ to push the files to GitHub.
